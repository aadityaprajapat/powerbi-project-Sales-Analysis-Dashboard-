# powerbi-project-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard-
🎉 Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI) My first self-driven Power BI project where I handled everything end-to-end — from asking the right business questions to transforming data, building DAX measures, designing interactive visuals, and deriving actionable insights.

## 🚀 What I Did
- ✅ Identified key business questions to answer
- ✅ Cleaned and transformed raw data using **Power Query**
- ✅ Created custom columns and measures with **DAX**
- ✅ Designed clear, interactive visuals and slicers
- ✅ Extracted insights such as:
  - Top performing cities by sales & profit
  - Sales trends across months and years
  - Performance of categories and sub-categories
  - Key KPIs: total sales, average order value, profit, etc.
